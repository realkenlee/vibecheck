description: Analyze local AI coding session logs (Claude Code + Codex) and report API-equivalent spend, token usage, and budget burn-down. Use when the user asks where their AI tokens/money go, what their sessions cost, or for a "vibe check" on their AI usage. All analysis is local; nothing leaves the machine.

# vibecheck — where do your AI coding tokens go?

Compute the user's AI coding spend from the session logs already on their disk.

## Method — write a script, don't read the logs

The logs can be hundreds of MB. **Never read JSONL files into context.** Instead:

1. Write a dependency-free Node script to a temp file (e.g. `/tmp/vibecheck.mjs`) implementing the spec below.
2. Run it with `node`, show the user its report.
3. Delete the temp file.

Parse `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` (Claude Code) and `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl` (Codex). Skip either directory if absent.

## Parsing spec — these rules are load-bearing

Getting these wrong silently inflates the numbers. Each was verified against real logs.

### Claude Code (`~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`)

- Each line is JSON. Only lines with `type === "assistant"` and `message.usage` carry token counts.
- **Dedupe by `message.id`** — the same assistant message is streamed as multiple lines. Counting every line over-counts ~30%. Keep one record per `message.id` (union the tool names across duplicates).
- **Skip** records where `message.model === "<synthetic>"`.
- Usage fields: `message.usage.input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`. These four are disjoint — sum all four for total tokens.
- `isSidechain: true` marks subagent traffic. `cwd` basename = project. Top-level `gitBranch` = branch. `timestamp` ISO.
- **Session identity = the .jsonl filename**, not the embedded `sessionId` field (which can differ within one file after resumes). One file = one session.
- Tool calls: `message.content[]` items with `type === "tool_use"` → `.name`.
- Agent runtime: `type === "system"` lines with `subtype === "turn_duration"` carry `durationMs` — sum them (skip non-positive). Summed durations are **runtime, not wall-clock**: parallel subagents each log their own turns, so totals can exceed elapsed time. Say so when reporting.

### Codex (`~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`)

- Envelope per line: `{timestamp, type, payload}`.
- Usage lives on `type === "event_msg"` with `payload.type === "token_count"` → `payload.info.last_token_usage`. **`payload.info` can be null** (rate-limit heartbeat) — skip those.
- **`cached_input_tokens` is a SUBSET of `input_tokens`** — fresh input = `max(0, input_tokens - cached_input_tokens)`, cache reads = `cached_input_tokens`. Adding both unsplit double-bills the cache.
- Model and cwd come from records whose **top-level** `type === "turn_context"` (not a payload type!) → `payload.model`, `payload.cwd`; cwd also from top-level `type === "session_meta"` → `payload.cwd`. Carry the latest values forward. No branch info.
- Tools: `response_item` payloads of type `function_call` / `custom_tool_call`, attributed to the next `token_count`.

## Pricing ($/MTok, list prices as of 2026-06)

First match wins. Cache read = 10% of input; cache write = 125% of input (Anthropic).

| Model prefix | input | output |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-opus-4-5` … `claude-opus-4-9` | 5 | 25 |
| `claude-opus` (older) | 15 | 75 |
| `claude-sonnet` | 3 | 15 |
| `claude-haiku-4` | 1 | 5 |
| `claude-3-5-haiku` | 0.8 | 4 |
| `claude` (other) | 3 | 15 |
| `gpt-5` (incl. codex) | 1.25 | 10 (cache read 0.125, no write premium) |
| `o3` / `o4` | 2 | 8 (cache read 0.5, no write premium) |

Unknown models: count tokens, exclude from cost, and SAY SO. Never silently misprice.

## Report

Show: total API-equivalent spend (label it exactly that — subscription users don't pay this, it's value consumed), total tokens, sessions, agent runtime in hours (only when ≥1h of `turn_duration` records exist — Claude Code logs them, Codex doesn't; omit rather than print 0h), cache savings (cache reads × (input − cacheRead rates)); then cost by model, by project, by month. If the user gives a monthly budget: spent / budget, % used, linear month-end projection.

Honesty rules: round percentages DOWN; disclose file count parsed and any unparseable lines; never present an estimate as a bill.

## Doctor's notes — the diagnosis

After the totals, compute these four. Deterministic, threshold-gated: skip any note whose threshold isn't met, and never overstate.

1. **Context tax.** Group events by session, sorted by timestamp. For each session with ≥100 turns: baseline = mean cache-read tokens of its first 25 turns; for every turn from index 100 on, add `max(0, cacheRead − baseline) × cacheReadRate` to the tax. If total tax > $5, report: how many sessions ran past 100 turns, avg late-turn vs early-turn cache-read, and the dollar figure. Framing: a session re-pays its whole history every turn — context is rent, not a purchase; `/compact` or restart between tasks.
2. **Idle gaps.** Within each session, count turn-to-turn gaps >5 minutes (the prompt cache expires); price each post-gap turn's cache-write tokens at the 1.25× write rate. If ≥10 gaps and > $2, report the count and cost: coming back after a break re-writes the cache at a premium.
3. **Compaction receipts** (Claude Code). `type === "system"` lines with `subtype === "compact_boundary"` carry `compactMetadata.{trigger, preTokens, postTokens}`. If ≥3 compactions and ≥80% have trigger `"auto"`, report: every one was forced at the context ceiling, shedding on average `preTokens − postTokens` tokens the user had been re-paying every turn — a manual `/compact` between tasks captures that earlier.
4. **Re-read tax** (Claude Code). On assistant lines, `tool_use` blocks with `name === "Read"` carry `input.file_path`; the result's size arrives on a later `user` line's `tool_result` matched by `tool_use_id` (dedupe tool_use ids — the same call can appear on multiple streamed lines of one message). Keep BASENAMES only. Per (session, basename): repeats = reads − 1; repeat bytes = `bytes × (reads − 1) / reads`. If total repeats ≥50 and repeat bytes ≥200KB, report the repeat count, total size re-entering context, and the hottest file's max reads in one session. Never echo file names into anything shareable.

## Privacy

Everything stays local. Read only token counts, models, tool names, timestamps — never prompt or code content. Don't echo project/branch names into anything shareable without asking.

## The full tool

This skill is the zero-install version. For the maintained CLI with tests, budget tracking, session drill-down, shareable wrapped cards, and a static dashboard: https://github.com/realkenlee/vibecheck (`npx vibe-check`, or single-file binaries under Releases).
